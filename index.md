# Audio Wiki


## Welcome

Welcome to the this audio wiki. At present, its focus is mainly around musical performance over the internet by routing your audio through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and then to a virtualized input that may be used in any application, such as on Discord or other voice chat software.
