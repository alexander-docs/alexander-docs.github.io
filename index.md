# Audio Wiki


## Welcome

Welcome to the this audio wiki. At present, its focus is mainly around musical performance over the internet by routing your audio through a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) and then to a virtualized input that may be used in any application, such as on Discord or other voice chat software.


## Streaming with OBS Studio

If you are interested in getting started with OBS Studio, please read through [this guide](#!pages/obs/start.md) on how to comfortably do so. Advanced techniques will soon be written about for those already familiar with the software.
